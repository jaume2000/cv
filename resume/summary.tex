ML researcher with a mathematical bent---trained in Chaos Theory, Neural ODEs, Algebraic Geometry, and Quantum Mechanics---who also ships production systems. My core interest is Mechanistic Interpretability: understanding \emph{why} a model works through causal, physically-grounded analysis rather than treating it as a black-box statistical artifact. I have designed neural architectures from first principles for medical imaging (brain MRI segmentation, 700k+ volumes) and high-density bioimage analysis (microbial colony counting). I build the full stack from theory to deployed inference because a model that cannot run reliably in the real world is an incomplete result.
